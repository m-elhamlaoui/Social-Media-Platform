# Description

This project aims to develop a social media application with a spatial theme. Here is a detailed description of the main components and features of the project:

### Social Media Platform:

The main objective is to create a platform where users can interact with each other, share space-related content, connect with other astronomy and space science enthusiasts, etc. Basic features include user authentication, profile management (with information such as biography, space interests, etc.), content posting, commenting on other users' posts, the ability to "like" posts, sending private messages, etc.

### Integration of NASA APIs:

To enrich the user experience, it is planned to integrate NASA APIs. This will allow users to access various space-related data and features, such as satellite images, information on ongoing space missions, planet data, etc. Different available APIs will be explored and those that best fit the application's needs will be selected.

### Addition of Additional Space Features:

In addition to basic social networking features, unique space-related features will be integrated. This could include interactive star map visualization, real-time space news broadcasting, space quizzes to test users' knowledge, etc. These features aim to enhance the user experience by providing content and activities specific to their passion for astronomy and space exploration.

In summary, this project aims to create a space-focused social media platform, providing users with the opportunity to interact, share content, and engage in space exploration-related activities, all while integrating data and features from NASA APIs.
